weighted-mean
=============

A small one-page-webapp for calculating the weighted average of a set of numbers. You can try it online on [the project's github page](http://vogelsgesang.github.io/weighted-mean/).

Currently the following features are supported:
* Addition and removal of entries
* Calculation of the weighted average of all entries
* Temporarily excluding entries from the calculation of the weigthed average
* Import and export from/to a JSON file

The entries are not stored server side. Hence, you must export your data before leaving the web page, if you do not want to lose your work.

I wrote this webapp some time ago in order to gain experience with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
In addition, I used [Angular-Strap](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/) and [Angular-xeditable](http://vitalets.github.io/angular-xeditable/).
